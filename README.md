# SQLite3 for Android

This repository contains the Android.mk and Application.mk along with SQLite3 [source](https://www.sqlite.org/2015/sqlite-amalgamation-3090100.zip) for building native sqlite3 binary for Android smartphones. 

This is especially useful for building sqlite3 binaries for x86 based devices like ASUS Zenfone 5. Precompiled binary for x86 is available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5_UZxmxKGUgOFV4ekFLZWV0Vk0/view?usp=sharing). 

The motivation for this repo is that there were no existing sqlite3 binaries for Zefone 5 (x86 arch) which is a great utiliy for many applications in rooted devies.
